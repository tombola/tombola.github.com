The implied excitement above is slightly disingenuous. Prezi is a familiar tool to most people working in education by now, but also the cause of frequent (literal) headaches, and thus not a drop in replacement for powerpoint (unlike google presentations, but that is another post)

Anyway, Prezi has its uses, and some academics/students find it can help them liven up an otherwise static presentation (when used carefully/sparingly).

I was recently notified that I had a free trial of the Prezi pro, which includes access to the desktop app recently, so I thought I would test it out.

Main differences between desktop and web version:

* you can work offline
* performance when dragging things about or using images is a little snappier

There really is little else. You can already [download a copy of your prezi](https://prezi.zendesk.com/entries/22441718-download-a-portable-prezi) from the web version of Prezi to use offline (no software required), so that is not a distinguishing feature. The app interface (sensibly) is exactly the same as the online experience

For a free education account, which already has the ability to get rid of the prezi logo, and allows private presentations, the only advantages of Prezi Edu Pro (~$5/month) are extra storage (2gb rather than 500mb), and the desktop app\*. 

###Verdict

The pro account (with desktop app) is a handy thing to have, if:

* you like using prezi to get your point across
* you are blighted by a slow internet connection
* you are a heavy user of prezi
* you would like to make/amend your presentation on the train

It might not be worth paying for the Edu Pro account if:

* you work in education (and have the free edu account)
* you have decent and reliable internet connection
* you do not travel by train (much)

Also worth considering is **whether to use Prezi at all**, but that mainly comes down to how easy you find it to use, what your content is, and your audience. I would say, with a high degree of bias - if you are a fan of stock imagery do not use Prezi (because in all likelihood you are also a headspinning prezi fan..)

\* *There is 'premium support' as well, but to be honest, if the online help resources are not up to scratch there is no point in engaging with a tool like this, which should hopefully be simple to use anyway.*
