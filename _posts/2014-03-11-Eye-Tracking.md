Eye tracking is on the way.

I know, we've had it for years, but its been tucked away in usability labs, and it cost a bomb.

I've been looking around to see if eye tracking might be within reach, cheap and off the shelf for usability testing. It doesn't seem to be quite there for my purposes, but we are tantalisingly close.

First you had to hold your head still.

Then you had to wear tiny cameras on a hat or glasses.

Now it looks like we might nearly be able to buy a compact, simple **cheap** device to handle all the complicated stuff and develop over the top of it.
