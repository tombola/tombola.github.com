I have a new blog. Intended subjects are Educational Technology, usability and accessibility, plus related issues.

The blog doesn't have that much on it yet. I intend mainly to use it in association with [twitter](https://twitter.com/tomreadings), so if I post I will tweet a link. It also may look a little crude to start with. At some point I will jazz it up, but I am telling myself that to do so now would be procrastination..

For background info on the blog see my post on [Simple Blogging](http://tombola.github.io/geekery/2014/02/10/simple-blogging/).
